Hello, 

My name is Ibrahim Yusufali. 

I am passionate about decentralized systems & blockchain technology.

I am an Indian / Tanzanian and call many places home. I was born in Mumbai, India. Grew up in Dubai, UAE. And now ~mainly~ live in London, UK.

Currently, I am a Researcher at Polychain Capital.
